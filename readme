I have made a website which consistes of 3 popular games which I like a lot and I used to play a lot when I was young thats why I made this website so people can play these 
games in there free time and enjoy. I have added 3 popular games which are Flappy fird, doodle jump and lastly rock paper scissors.

I added some animation for the side I also used AI to help me with the gaming side as I am very new to game design and plappy fird was the real issue as there were a lot of gaming
physics which was a difficult task for me so I had to use some toturials and AI as well but for the designing stuff I used my own html and css skills and also used javascript skills
to make some stugg interactive. 

I took the design idea from pintrest so I could made a real good looking website. I changed some of the designing insted of copying the whole pintrest design as it could be copying
and I dont want to do that.
